There could be traps

Some items could be cursed or blessed... though I'm not sure what they would do.

Right now, the inventory is just a set seven slots. Maybe I'll implement different pages that you switch between using the left and right buttons. There would be a page
for each item type probably.

Maybe you'll be able to equip items?

Add rings that when you equip them, grant you a buff or debuff in things like speed, damage, etc.

Maybe if the level of love is high enough, instead of the damsel following behind you, you are literally carrying her- this would mean that you couldn't shoot her.
The "rescuedamselscreen" would change to, instead of the normal one, one where the wizard is carrying the damsel.

Maybe for the boss fight, right at the end of the boss fight, the music
changes to a different tune as you're almost done.

For the boss fight, it could be that you have to find a bunch of shield generators or something in each room of the current dungeon, destroy them, and only then
could you hurt the boss.

For when I get a greyscale display, there could be a setting which toggles between dithering and grescale for shading in the status screens, so I would need to make
two of each of those screens. One with dithering which I already have, and one with greyscale instead.

Could have for when I get greyscale screen, the walls don't go directly from bright to dim, they might be able to sort of fade

Need to scale enemy hp with levels- but also make the player have some way of getting an increase in damage.

The player could level up the more kills they get, and therefore increase in health.

Add a see-all potion that makes the walls all not be dim and the player being able to see enemies etc through walls. Maybe there would be a NPC that you couldn't
normally see without it?
