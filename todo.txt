There could be traps

Some items could be cursed or blessed... though I'm not sure what they would do.

Right now, the inventory is just a set seven slots. Maybe I'll implement different pages that you switch between using the left and right buttons. There would be a page
for each item type probably.

Maybe you'll be able to equip items?

Right after you use a potion or any item, it should tell you what you just did or what that item did when you used it.

Add rings that when you equip them, grant you a buff or debuff in things like speed, damage, etc.

Maybe if the level of love is high enough, instead of the damsel following behind you, you are literally carrying her- this would mean that you couldn't shoot her.
The "rescuedamselscreen" would change to, instead of the normal one, one where the wizard is carrying the damsel.

Maybe for the boss fight, right at the end of the boss fight, the music
changes to a different tune as you're almost done.

Boxes that spawns around the map that you could shoot to destroy to release loot.

For the boss fight, it could be that you have to find a bunch of shield generators or something in each room of the current dungeon, destroy them, and only then
could you hurt the boss.

Need to scale enemy hp with levels- but also make the player have some way of getting an increase in damage.

The player could level up the more kills they get, and therefore increase in health.

Need to not be able to see enemies behind walls.
