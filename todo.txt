There could be traps

Maybe if the level of love is high enough, instead of the damsel following behind you, you are literally carrying her- this would mean that you couldn't shoot her.
The "rescuedamselscreen" would change to, instead of the normal one, one where the wizard is carrying the damsel.

Maybe for the boss fight, right at the end of the boss fight, the music
changes to a different tune as you're almost done.

Boxes that spawns around the map that you could shoot to destroy to release loot.

For the boss fight, it could be that you have to find a bunch of shield generators or something in each room of the current dungeon, destroy them, and only then
could you hurt the boss.

Need to scale enemy hp with levels- but also make the player have some way of getting an increase in damage.

Need to not be able to see enemies behind walls.

Sometimes there are rooms that spawn right at the edge of the map, and if you walk to the edge of them, it glitches kind of. Might need to make a margin from the world
edge for the rooms to spawn in.
