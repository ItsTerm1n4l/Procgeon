There could be traps

There could be a level of "love" or "loyalty" or "bond" or "trust" between you and the current damsel, which grows with each level you manage to guide her through
and each time you rescue her. It'll reset if you don't get her or kill her though of course.

Right now on the damsel death screen it says "you killed the damsel... how could you! she trusted you!" but "how could you" could be added when the level of love
is above a smallish amount, and it would only add "she trusted you!" when the level of love was above a bigger amount.

Maybe if the level of love is high enough, instead of the damsel following behind you, you are literally carrying her- this would mean that you couldn't shoot her.
The "rescuedamselscreen" would change to, instead of the normal one, one where the wizard is carrying the damsel.

The minimap needs to not be gotten at first bootup. It needs to be found in like the third or fourth of the dungeons.

When I add sound, there could be different music that plays for when the damsel is following you or if you've just killed the damsel or if you're alone.
For example, the default dungeon music is playing when you first go into the dungeon. Then when you pick up the damsel, the music changes.
(that'll be the music that plays instead of the default music as long as the damsel is with you) Then if you kill the damsel,
the music for that dungeon will be sad. Then it'll go back to normal default music.

Boxes that spawns around the map that you could shoot to destroy to release loot.

For the boss fight, it could be that you have to find a bunch of shield generators or something in each room of the current dungeon, destroy them, and only then
could you hurt the boss.

Need to scale enemy hp with levels- but also make the player have some way of getting an increase in damage.

Need to not be able to see enemies behind walls.

Sometimes there are rooms that spawn right at the edge of the map, and if you walk to the edge of them, it glitches kind of. Might need to make a margin from the world
edge for the rooms to spawn in.
