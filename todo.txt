There could be traps- Arrow traps that shoot in a straight line out of the wall, teleporters that teleport the player to a random place in the map, and spike traps that
deal damage when stepped on.

Some items could be cursed or blessed... one thing that these curses could do is increase the enemy awareness radius, and blessed items, when equipped, in addition
to their normal function, could like add a max health bonus or speed bonus- but only when wearing that item.

Maybe you'll be able to equip items?

Add rings that when you equip them, grant you a buff or debuff in things like speed, damage, or even one that is called The Ring of Power or The One Ring that makes you
invisible to enemies- unfortunately, invisible to the damsel as well. That ring would only be used in solo runs when you don't care about the damsel maybe.

The enemies need to have better wandering mechanics. Maybe more complex wandering for different enemies?

Maybe for the boss fight, right at the end of the boss fight, the music
changes to a different tune as you're almost done.

For the boss fight, it could be that you have to find a bunch of shield generators or something in each room of the current dungeon, destroy them, and only then
could you hurt the boss.

Need to scale enemy hp and damage with levels- but also make the player have some way of getting an increase in damage.

The player could level up the more kills they get, and therefore increase in health. The player would be able to see their status (level, health, etc in greater
detail) by pressing "select" button. The player would be able to pause the game using "start" button.

Add a see-all potion that makes the walls all not be dim and the player being able to see enemies etc through walls. Maybe there would be a NPC that you couldn't
normally see without it? Also highlights secret passages?

Add a chaos potion that has randomized effects on each use.

For when the player has a speed boost or any other effect, there would be a icon on the normal UI like a boot for speed or eye for see-all.

There would be scrolls containing lore that you find around the map.

There could be secret doors- walls you could walk through to another room that might be full of loot.

There could be an enemy type that has a randomly generated sprite.

Since people will probably think it's sexist to have a wizard carrying a damsel, on the title screen or boot up, you'll be given two options: male or female. This will make
it so that instead of you controlling a male wizard and saving a female damsel, you'll control a female witch and you would find a male damsel/prince. The prince would
complain a lot while following you at first, making you want to shoot him. The main bad guy would be a female instead of a male when you're a witch.

As an easter egg, maybe in a very secret room, there would be a pool that has some cellular automata living in it that you can watch and randomize by going and pressing a
button on the wall next to it. The cellular automaton would be the Game of Life I think.

Add a slowing potion.

Maybe implement a hunger mechanic with food items you can find.

(this won't be in the crafting matrix) you might be able to mix any potion with any food item (if I implement those) and it would make the food item have a healing/damaging
or slowing/speeding effect based on the potion in addition to recovering hunger.
